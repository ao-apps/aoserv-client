TODO: These should be moved to a new ao-client-sql project.

The aoserv-client should use Java comparator based sorting and SortedSet for
more natural behavior with the Java language.  Please see ao-rtd for an example
structure.

This should alleviate the core dependency on this SQL-like behavior, and thus
allow this to become a separate package, which may be a dependency of AOSH, or
included as an additional AOSH module which adds the "select", "describe", and
similar commands.
